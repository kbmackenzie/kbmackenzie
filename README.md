Hi, I'm Kelly! I adore functional programming and esoteric languages! ðŸŒ¸

I adore Haskell, it's my favorite language and my current obsession. I also adore TypeScript, Elixir, Lua and C#!

I also contribute to the [Inscryption modding API](https://thunderstore.io/c/inscryption/p/API_dev/API/) and make [Cult of the Lamb](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/KellyBetty/mods) mods!
